* `transit_router_multicast_domain_id` - (ForceNew, Required) The ID of the multicast domain to which the multicast member belongs.
* `peer_transit_router_multicast_domains` - (ForceNew, Optional) The IDs of the inter-region multicast domains.
* `resource_id` - (ForceNew, Optional) The ID of the resource associated with the multicast resource.
* `resource_type` - (ForceNew, Optional) The type of the multicast resource. Valid values:

* `members` - A list of Transit Router Multicast Domain Peer Member Entries. Each element contains the following attributes:
    * `id` - The `key` of the resource supplied above.The value is formulated as `<transit_router_multicast_domain_id>:<group_ip_address>:<peer_transit_router_multicast_domain_id>`.
    * `group_ip_address` - The IP address of the multicast group to which the multicast member belongs. Value range: **224.0.0.1** to **239.255.255.254**.If the multicast group you specified does not exist in the current multicast domain, the system will automatically create a new multicast group for you in the current multicast domain.
    * `peer_transit_router_multicast_domain_id` - The multicast domain ID of the peer transit router.
    * `status` - The status of the resource
    * `transit_router_multicast_domain_id` - The ID of the multicast domain to which the multicast member belongs.
