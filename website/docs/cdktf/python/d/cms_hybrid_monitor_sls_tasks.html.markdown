# alicloud\_cms\_hybrid\_monitor\_sls\_tasks

This data source provides the Cms Hybrid Monitor Sls Tasks of the current Alibaba Cloud user.

-> **NOTE:** Available in v1.179.0+.

## Example Usage

Basic Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.alicloud as alicloud
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        data_alicloud_cms_hybrid_monitor_sls_tasks_ids =
        alicloud.data_alicloud_cms_hybrid_monitor_sls_tasks.DataAlicloudCmsHybridMonitorSlsTasks(self, "ids",
            ids=["example_value"]
        )
        cdktf.TerraformOutput(self, "cms_hybrid_monitor_sls_task_id_1",
            value=cdktf.property_access(data_alicloud_cms_hybrid_monitor_sls_tasks_ids.tasks, ["0", "id"])
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `ids` - (Optional, ForceNew, Computed)  A list of Hybrid Monitor Sls Task IDs.

* `namespace` - (Optional, ForceNew) The name of the namespace.
* `output_file` - (Optional) File name where to save data source results (after running `terraform plan`).

## Argument Reference

The following attributes are exported in addition to the arguments listed above:

         * `name` - The key of the tag.
         * `value` - The value of the tag.
    * `collect_interval` - The interval between the cloud monitoring plug-in collecting host monitoring data.
    * `collect_target_endpoint` - The address where the cloudmonitor Plug-In collects the monitoring data of the host.
    * `collect_target_path` - When the cloud monitor Agent collects, the relative path of the collection.
    * `collect_target_type` - The type of the monitoring data. Valid values: Spring, Tomcat, Nginx, Tengine, JVM, Redis, MySQL, and AWS.
    * `collect_timout` - The timeout period for the cloudmonitor plug-in to collect host monitoring data.
