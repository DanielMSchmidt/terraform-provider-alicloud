<!-- Please do not edit this file, it is generated. -->
# alicloud\_regions

This data source provides Alibaba Cloud regions.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.alicloud as alicloud
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        data_alicloud_regions_current_region_ds =
        alicloud.data_alicloud_regions.DataAlicloudRegions(self, "current_region_ds",
            current=True
        )
        cdktf.TerraformOutput(self, "current_region_id",
            value=cdktf.property_access(data_alicloud_regions_current_region_ds.regions, ["0", "id"
            ])
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Optional) The name of the region to select, such as `eu-central-1`.
* `current` - (Optional) Set to true to match only the region configured in the provider.
* `output_file` - (Optional) File name where to save data source results (after running `terraform plan`).

~> **NOTE:** You will get an error if you set `current` to true and `name` to a different value from the one you configured in the provider.
 It is better to either use `name` or `current`, but not both at the same time.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported in addition to the arguments listed above:

* `ids` - A list of region IDs.
* `regions` - A list of regions. Each element contains the following attributes:
  * `id` - ID of the region.
  * `local_name` - Name of the region in the local language.
