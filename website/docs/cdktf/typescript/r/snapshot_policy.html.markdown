```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as alicloud from "./.gen/providers/alicloud";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new alicloud.snapshotPolicy.SnapshotPolicy(this, "sp", {
      name: "tf-testAcc-sp",
      repeatWeekdays: ["1", "2", "3"],
      retentionDays: cdktf.Token.asNumber(cdktf.Op.negate(1)),
      timePoints: ["1", "22", "23"],
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

When you want to schedule multiple automatic snapshot tasks for a disk in a week, you can set the RepeatWeekdays to an array.
    - A maximum of seven time points can be selected.
    - The format is  an JSON array of ["1", "2", … "7"]  and the time points are separated by commas (,).
* `retentionDays` - (Required) The snapshot retention time, and the unit of measurement is day. Optional values:
    - -1: The automatic snapshots are retained permanently.
    - [1, 65536]: The number of days retained.
    
    Default value: -1.
* `timePoints` - (Required) The automatic snapshot creation schedule, and the unit of measurement is hour. Value range: [0, 23], which represents from 00:00 to 24:00,  for example 1 indicates 01:00. When you want to schedule multiple automatic snapshot tasks for a disk in a day, you can set the TimePoints to an array.
    - A maximum of 24 time points can be selected.
    - The format is  an JSON array of ["0", "1", … "23"] and the time points are separated by commas (,).
