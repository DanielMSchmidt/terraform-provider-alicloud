# alicloud\_ecs\_prefix\_list\

Provides a ECS Prefix List resource.

For information about ECS Prefix List and how to use it, see [What is Prefix List.](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/doc-detail/207969.html).

-> **NOTE:** Available in v1.152.0+.

## Example Usage

Basic Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as alicloud from "./.gen/providers/alicloud";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new alicloud.ecsPrefixList.EcsPrefixList(this, "default", {
      addressFamily: "IPv4",
      description: "description",
      entry: [
        {
          cidr: "192.168.0.0/24",
          description: "description",
        },
      ],
      maxEntries: 2,
      prefixListName: "tftest",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `addressFamily` - (Required, ForceNew) The IP address family. Valid values: `iPv4`,`iPv6`.
* `maxEntries` - (Required, ForceNew) The maximum number of entries that the prefix list can contain.  Valid values: 1 to 200.
* `prefixListName` - (Required) The name of the prefix. The name must be 2 to 128 characters in length. It must start with a letter and cannot start with `http://`, `https://`, `comAliyun`, or `comAlibabacloud`. It can contain letters, digits, colons (:), underscores (_), periods (.), and hyphens (-).
* `description` - (Optional) The description of the prefix list. The description must be 2 to 256 characters in length and cannot start with `http://` or `https://`.
* `entry` - (Required) The Entry. The details see Block `entry`. 



#### entry
The entry supports the following:

* `cidr` - (Optional) The CIDR block in entry. This parameter is empty by default.  Take note of the following items:
  * The total number of entries must not exceed the `maxEntries` value.
  * CIDR block types are determined by the IP address family. You cannot combine `iPv4` and `iPv6` CIDR blocks in a single entry.
  * CIDR blocks must be unique across all entries in a prefix list. For example, you cannot specify 192.168.1.0/24 twice in the entries of the prefix list.
  * IP addresses are supported. The system converts IP addresses into CIDR blocks. For example, if you specify 192.168.1.100, the system converts it into the 192.168.1.100/32 CIDR block.
  * If an IPv6 CIDR block is used, the system converts it to the zero compression format and changes uppercase letters into lowercase ones. For example, if you specify 2001:0DB8:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/32, the system converts it into 2001:db8::/32.
  * For more information about CIDR blocks, see the "What is CIDR block?" section of the [Network FAQ](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/40637.htm) topic.  * The total number of entries must not exceed the `maxEntries` value.
* `description` - (Optional) The description in entry. The description must be 2 to 32 characters in length and cannot start with `http://` or `https://`.

* `id` - The resource ID in terraform of Prefix List.
