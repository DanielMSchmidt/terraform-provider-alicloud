## Example Usage

Basic Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as alicloud from "./.gen/providers/alicloud";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    /*Terraform Variables are not always the best fit for getting inputs in the context of Terraform CDK.
    You can read more about this at https://cdk.tf/variables*/
    const name = new cdktf.TerraformVariable(this, "name", {
      default: "valut-name",
    });
    const alicloudHbrVaultDefault = new alicloud.hbrVault.HbrVault(
      this,
      "default",
      {
        vaultName: name.stringValue,
      }
    );
    const dataAlicloudInstancesDefault =
      new alicloud.dataAlicloudInstances.DataAlicloudInstances(
        this,
        "default_2",
        {
          nameRegex: "no-deleteing-hbr-ecs-backup-plan",
          status: "Running",
        }
      );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    dataAlicloudInstancesDefault.overrideLogicalId("default");
    new alicloud.hbrEcsBackupPlan.HbrEcsBackupPlan(this, "example", {
      backupType: "COMPLETE",
      ecsBackupPlanName: "example_value",
      exclude: '  ["/home/exclude"]\n',
      include: '  ["/home/include"]\n',
      instanceId: cdktf.Token.asString(
        cdktf.propertyAccess(dataAlicloudInstancesDefault.instances, [
          "0",
          "id",
        ])
      ),
      path: ["/home", "/var"],
      retention: "1",
      schedule: "I|1602673264|PT2H",
      speedLimit: "0:24:5120",
      vaultId: cdktf.Token.asString(alicloudHbrVaultDefault.id),
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are support:

* `ecsBackupPlanName` - (Required) The name of the backup plan. 1~64 characters, the backup plan name of each data source type in a single warehouse required to be unique.
* `vaultId` - (Required, ForceNew) The ID of Backup vault.
* `instanceId` - (Required, ForceNew) The ID of ECS instance. The ecs backup client must have been installed on the host.
* `retention` - (Required) Backup retention days, the minimum is 1.
* `backupType` - (Required, ForceNew) Backup type. Valid values: `complete`.
* `schedule` - (Required) Backup strategy. Optional format: `i|{startTime}|{interval}`. It means to execute a backup task every `{interval}` starting from `{startTime}`. The backup task for the elapsed time will not be compensated. If the last backup task has not completed yet, the next backup task will not be triggered.
    * `startTime` Backup start time, UNIX time seconds.
    * `interval` ISO8601 time interval. E.g: `pt1H` means one hour apart. `p1D` means one day apart. 
* `disabled` - (Optional) Whether to disable the backup task. Valid values: `true`, `false`.
* `options` - (Optional) Windows operating system with application consistency using VSS, e.g: `{\"useVss\":false}`.
* `speedLimit` - (Optional) Flow control. The format is: `{start}|{end}|{bandwidth}`. Use `|` to separate multiple flow control configurations, multiple flow control configurations not allowed to have overlapping times.
    * `start` starting hour 
    * `end` end hour 
    * `bandwidth` limit rate, in KiB
* `path` - (Optional) List of backup path. e.g. `["/home", "/var"]`. **Note** If `path` is empty, it means that all directories will be backed up.
* `exclude` - (Optional) Exclude path. String of Json list, up to 255 characters. e.g. `"[\"/home/work\"]"`
* `include` - (Optional) Include path. String of Json list, up to 255 characters. e.g. `"[\"/var\"]"`
* `updatePaths` - (Optional, Deprecated from v1.139.0+) Attribute update_paths has been deprecated in v1.139.0+, and you do not need to set it anymore.
* `detail` - (Optional) The detail of the backup plan.
* `crossAccountType` - (Optional, ForceNew, Computed, Available in v1.189.0+) The type of the cross account backup. Valid values: `selfAccount`, `crossAccount`.
* `crossAccountUserId` - (Optional, ForceNew, Available in v1.189.0+) The original account ID of the cross account backup managed by the current account.
* `crossAccountRoleName` - (Optional, ForceNew, Available in v1.189.0+) The role name created in the original account RAM backup by the cross account managed by the current account.

## Notice

**About Backup path rules:**
1. If there is no wildcard `*`, you can enter 8 items of path.
2. When using wildcard `*`, only one item of path can be input, and wildcards like `/*/*` are supported.
3. Each item of path only supports absolute paths, for example starting with `/`, `\`, `c:\`, `d:\`.

**About Restrictions:**
1. When using `vss`: multiple paths, UNC paths, wildcards, and excluded files not supported.
2. When using `unc`: VSS not supported, wildcards not supported, and files to be excluded are not supported.

**About include/exclude path rules:**
1. Supports up to 8 paths, including paths using wildcards `*`.
2. If the path does not contain `/`, then `*` matches multiple path names or file names, for example `*abc*` will match `/abc/`, `/d/eabcd/`, `/a/abc`; `*Txt` will match all files with an extension `txt`.
3. If the path contains `/`, each `*` only matches a single-level path or file name. For example, `/a/*/*/` share will match `/a/b/c/share`, but not `/a/d/share`.
4. If the path ends with `/`, it means the folder matches. For example, `*tmp/` will match `/a/b/aaatmp/`, `/tmp/` and so on.
5. The path separator takes Linux system `/` as an example, if it is Windows system, please replace it with `\`.

## Attributes Reference
