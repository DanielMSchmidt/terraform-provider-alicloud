See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as alicloud from "./.gen/providers/alicloud";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const dataAlicloudGaCustomRoutingEndpointTrafficPoliciesIds =
      new alicloud.dataAlicloudGaCustomRoutingEndpointTrafficPolicies.DataAlicloudGaCustomRoutingEndpointTrafficPolicies(
        this,
        "ids",
        {
          acceleratorId: "your_accelerator_id",
          ids: ["example_id"],
        }
      );
    new cdktf.TerraformOutput(
      this,
      "ga_custom_routing_endpoint_traffic_policies_id_1",
      {
        value: cdktf.propertyAccess(
          dataAlicloudGaCustomRoutingEndpointTrafficPoliciesIds.customRoutingEndpointTrafficPolicies,
          ["0", "id"]
        ),
      }
    );
  }
}
