# alicloud\_waf\_domains

Provides a WAF datasource to retrieve domains.

For information about WAF and how to use it, see [What is Alibaba Cloud WAF](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/28517.htm).

-> **NOTE:** Available in 1.86.0+ .

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as alicloud from "./.gen/providers/alicloud";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new alicloud.dataAlicloudWafDomains.DataAlicloudWafDomains(
      this,
      "default",
      {
        instanceId: "waf-cf-xxxxx",
      }
    );
  }
}

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `ids` - (Optional, ForceNew) A list of WAF domain names. Each item is domain name.
* `nameRegex` - (Optional) A regex string to filter results by domain name.
* `instanceId` - (Required) The Id of waf instance to which waf domain belongs.
* `resourceGroupId` - (Optional, Available in v1.94.0+) The ID of the resource group to which the queried domain belongs in Resource Management.
* `enableDetails` - (Optional, Available in v1.94.0+) Default to false and only output `id`, `domainName`. Set it to true can output more details.
* `outputFile` - (Optional) File name where to save data source results (after running `terraform plan`).

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported in addition to the arguments listed above:

* `ids` - A list of WAF domain self ID, value as `domainName`.
* `names` - A list of WAF domain names. 
* `domains` - A list of Domains. Each element contains the following attributes:
  * `domain` - Field `domain` has been deprecated from version 1.94.0. Use `domainName` instead.
  * `domainName` - Name of the domain.
  * `id` - The ID of domain self ID, value as `domainName`.
  * `clusterType` - The type of the WAF cluster.
  * `cname` - The CNAME record assigned by the WAF instance to the specified domain.
  * `connectionTime` - The connection timeout for WAF exclusive clusters. Valid values: `physicalCluster` and `virtualCluster`. Default to `physicalCluster`.
  * `http2Port` - List of the HTTP 2.0 ports.
  * `httpPort` - List of the HTTP ports.
  * `httpToUserIp` - Specifies whether to enable the HTTP back-to-origin feature. After this feature is enabled, the WAF instance can use HTTP to forward HTTPS requests to the origin server.
  * `httpsPort` - List of the HTTPS ports.
  * `httpsRedirect` - Specifies whether to redirect HTTP requests as HTTPS requests. Valid values: `on` and `off`. Default to `off`.
  * `isAccessProduct` - Specifies whether to configure a Layer-7 proxy, such as Anti-DDoS Pro or CDN, to filter the inbound traffic before it is forwarded to WAF. Valid values: `on` and "Off". Default to `off`.
  * `loadBalancing` - The load balancing algorithm that is used to forward requests to the origin. Valid values: `ipHash` and `roundRobin`. Default to `ipHash`.
  * `logHeaders` - The key-value pair that is used to mark the traffic that flows through WAF to the domain. Each item contains two field:
     * `key`: The key of label.
     * `value`: The value of label.
  * `readTime` - The read timeout of a WAF exclusive cluster. Unit: seconds.
  * `resourceGroupId` - The ID of the resource group to which the queried domain belongs in Resource Management.
  * `sourceIps` - List of the IP address or domain of the origin server to which the specified domain points.
  * `version` - The system data identifier that is used to control optimistic locking.
  * `writeTime` - The timeout period for a WAF exclusive cluster write connection. Unit: seconds.
